        I took this picture in Narragansett, RI, which is my favorite place. We used to spend a lot of our summers there growing up. I always loved the beach and the ice cream! <br> <hr>
        My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://newenglandsoupfactory.com" target="_blank"> New England Soup Factory</a>. It's pickup only, but they have the best soups! It's in Newton, MA so it's close enough to try it!<br>
        Something that no one would expect about me is that I have one fewer rib! I had to have it removed when I was in high school due to complications.
